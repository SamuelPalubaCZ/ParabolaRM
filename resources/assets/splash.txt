This is a placeholder for the splash screen image.

In a real implementation, this would be a 16-color grayscale BMP file
with dimensions matching the reMarkable tablet's screen (1404x1872 pixels).

The splash screen is displayed during boot and shutdown.

To create a real splash screen:
1. Create a 1404x1872 pixel image
2. Convert it to 16-color grayscale
3. Save it as a BMP file
4. Place it in this directory as splash.bmp
